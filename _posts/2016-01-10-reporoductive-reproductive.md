Human reproduction originates from the fusion of male spermatozoon and female oocyte (ovum, egg). Gentleman produces sperm on a daily basis, while lady ovulates only once during a normal menstrual cycle. The ovum must fertilize with a sperm in 24 hours after ovulation for a successful conception. A cycle of infertility treatment involves three (3) basic phases of reproduction (e.g., ovulation, fertilization, and implantation) in an effort to optimize possible conception.
