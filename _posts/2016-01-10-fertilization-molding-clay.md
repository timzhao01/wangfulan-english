In vitro Fertilization (IVF) is one of the most common techniques with high successful rate in assisted reproductive technology to date. It helps women to overcome the difficulty of fertilization, conception and pregnancy. In natural pregnancy, fertilization takes place at the outer one third area of fallopian tube. The fallopian tube has three main functions: (a) it picks up ovulated ovum, (b) it provides an adequate environment for fertilization to occur and, (c) it transports the fertilized egg (embryo) to the uterus, so that implantation can take place at the endometrium of uterus. Once the fallopian tube is not functional or is otherwise impediments to fertility, the function of the fallopian tube and conception process can be substituted by IVF.


The principles of IVF include: (a) pick-up of eggs from the ovary, sperm-egg fertilization happening in the laboratory and, (b) subsequent placement of the fertilized eggs (embryos) in the uterus. The procedures of IVF basically include: (a) Ovarian Stimulation & Egg Retrieval, (b) Fertilization and ICSI, (c) Embryo Transfer & Luteal Phase Support.
