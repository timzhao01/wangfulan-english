Infertility equally attacks men and women; Infertility affects approximately 15% of couples; there were 6.1 million couples infertile in the U.S. 1997. According to U.S. NIH report, sperm densities in the U.S. have exhibited an average decrease at about 1.5 % annually, while those in European countries have declined at approximately 3.1 % yearly. Sperm decline worse than believed earlier. Men in many countries are becoming less fertile. Issues have raised the public concerns.


Varieties of microorganisms are frequently found in semen and contaminate sperm preparations used for artificial inseminations. These microorganisms may cause pelvic inflammatory diseases or interfere with the fertilization process. A normal semen sample may contain a considerable amount of abnormal sperm nuclear chromatin that may lead to reproductive failure or frequent/habitual abortion subsequent to fertilization. The preparation of a full normal-chromatin sperm specimen is valuable in fertility therapy.


In addition, for the purpose of the benefits of human beings as well as of preservation of rare/precious animals, it is then, of course, of paramount importance to apply an excellent technology for the improvement and excellence of reproduction of farm animals and those rare/precious animals.


The Wang Tube Real-Time Sperm Micro-Separation System (Wang Tube System), discovered by Dr. FN Wang et al at the University of California Irvine Medical Center, separates highly-motile, microorganisms-free, morphologically-normal, normal-chromatin and fertilizable sperm from a mixed cell sample for any procedure of artificial inseminations, i.e., in vivo, or in vitro fertilization (test tube baby). The Wang Tube System is Superb and Ultimate in Human and Farm Animal Sperm/Motile Cell Selection, and is the World Leading Technology/Product in Reproductive Medicine/Andrology for fertility therapy and/or for the offspring of excellence. This system has been awarded the “Invention Patents” of USA, England, France, Canada, Australia, China, Taiwan, and Japan, etc. It has also been included in four (4) American Books of Reproductive Science, e.g., “Assisted Human Reproductive Technology”, “Atlas of Clinical Andrology”, “A Handbook of Human Cytogenetics” (3rd Edition) and “Reproduction in Farm Animals” (7th Edition). The Wang Tube System also won many International Invention Gold Medals and Medical Awards from Germany, Switzerland, USA, and Taiwan, etc.


It is concluded that the Wang Tube System is the best technology in the world in motile cell selection, including human / higher class mammalian sperm cells and/or microscopic motile algae, for any type of artificial inseminations. It is crucial to set up this training program, which is unique in the world.
