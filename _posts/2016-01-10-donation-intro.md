The principle of egg donation involves IVF cycle for two parties (donor and recipient). The donor must undergo the first part of IVF, including ovarian stimulation and egg retrieval, whereas the recipient must undergo the embryo transfer. Doctor needs to synchronize these two women's menstrual cycles that can be achieved by a combination of birth control pills and Lupron.


When the cycle begins, the donor takes the usual stimulatory medications used for fertility therapy, whereas the recipient takes a combination of estrogen and progesterone to prepare her uterine lining for embryo transfer and subsequent implantation. When the donor's eggs become mature, the donor will undergo the standard procedure of follicle aspiration by trans-vaginal ultrasound-guided technique under conscious sedation. The recipient's partner provides the sperm. The sperm of the recipient's partner and the egg of the donor fertilize in laboratory as that of standard IVF procedure.


Embryo transfer is usually scheduled for day 5 (blastocyst), unless other factors dictate a transfer on day 3. After the embryo transfer is performed, the recipient continues to take estrogen and progesterone until the end of the first trimester of pregnancy. Since in natural conception, the ovary produces estrogen and progesterone in order to support embryo implantation. At the end of the first trimester (13 weeks of gestation age, or about 10-11 weeks after embryo transfer), the placenta will produce all kinds of hormones that are needed, and estrogen and progesterone supplementation can be withdrawn.


Egg donation is a type of fertility therapy, which allows women who are either lack of eggs by their own, or whose egg quality is not good enough to achieve their goal of pregnancy. At the present time, it is indicated for women (a) who fail to become pregnant after multiple cycles of in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment, (b) those with premature ovarian failure, (c) those with sustained elevated FSH levels, and (d) those are above the age of 43.


Infertile couples are welcomed to bring or recruit their own egg donors; we encourage egg donation by female relatives of the intended mother. Third party egg donation is offered for women who wish to donate their eggs under their own volition, altruism and a genuine sense of wishing to help the needs. ompensation is a part of the donation process.


The American Fertility Center maintains some registries of highly selected egg donors who wish to make the "gift of life" for infertile couples who seek for help. Any women of any race (e.g., Caucasian, Asian or Black) who wish to become a part of our donor registry should be at ages of 21 - 28 with an excellent self and family health history and measurable high intelligence. A confidential inquiry can be made; please call Egg Donor Program of our center at Toll Free No. 877. 592. 3456; or Tel 626. 336. 6368.
